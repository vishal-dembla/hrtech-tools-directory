# HRTech Tools Directory

This project was created to provide a lightweight, high-performance, and visually elegant directory for HR and Talent tools. It's designed for recruiters, hiring managers, and HR professionals who value curated discovery and fast access.

The site’s speed and design are inspired by two brilliant projects:
1MB Club for its minimal, performance-first philosophy, and Evil Rabbit for its refined aesthetic and typography.

Maintained by Vishal Dembla — with support from AI assistants including ChatGPT, Google AI Studio, and Lovable.

## What It Does

This site helps users discover and explore a growing list of HRTech tools across 14 categories — including sourcing, ATS, engagement, onboarding, resume tools, and more. Built to be fast and minimalist, it loads instantly and requires no login or setup.

It eliminates the noise of bloated HR software directories by:

- Curating & categorizing HrTech Tools 
- Highlighting free tools and emerging solutions alongside established platforms  
- Offering an integrated blog with category lists, tool reviews, and guides

## Why This Exists

Most HR tool directories are cluttered, outdated, or focused on paid listings. This project was created to provide a clear, fast-loading alternative that puts usability and discoverability first — especially for those who work in recruiting and HR every day.

It’s also an experiment in building useful content and design-driven products without relying on complex stacks.

## What It Does

This site helps users discover and explore a growing list of HRTech tools across 14 categories — including sourcing, ATS, engagement, onboarding, resume tools, and more. Built to be fast and minimalist, it loads instantly and requires no login or setup.

It eliminates the noise of bloated HR software directories by:

- Curating tools relevant for modern recruiting and HR workflows  
- Categorizing them clearly for top-of-funnel, mid-funnel, and post-hire functions  
- Highlighting free tools and emerging solutions alongside established platforms  
- Offering an integrated blog with practical sourcing tips, tool reviews, and guides

## Why This Exists

Most HR tool directories are cluttered, outdated, or focused on paid listings. This project was created to provide a clear, fast-loading alternative that puts usability and discoverability first — especially for those who work in recruiting and HR every day.

It’s also an experiment in building useful content and design-driven products without relying on complex stacks.
